🚀 **Cyber Security Internship – Task 1: Introduction to Network Security Basics**

## 📄 Overview

This repository documents my first task during the Cyber Security Internship at **FutureTrix**. Task 1 involved understanding fundamental network security concepts, setting up a secure virtual network environment, enabling and configuring firewalls, and analyzing traffic using Wireshark.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand key network threats like viruses, trojans, phishing, DoS/DDoS, ransomware, and more.
- Learn basic security principles including firewalls, encryption, and secure configurations.
- Configure a basic network lab using Oracle VM VirtualBox.
- Enable and configure Windows Defender Firewall.
- Capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark.
- Automate IP blocking using scripts.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- 💻 **Windows Defender Firewall**
- 📡 **Wireshark**
- 🖥️ **Oracle VM VirtualBox**
- 🐧 **Ubuntu & Kali Linux (VMs)**
- 📜 **Automation Scripts (Batch)**

## 🧪 Lab Setup Steps

1. Created a host-only network in VirtualBox.
2. Installed Ubuntu and Kali Linux VMs.
3. Connected both to the same subnet using the host-only adapter.
4. Verified connectivity using `ping`.
5. Enabled and configured Windows Firewall to block unauthorized access.
6. Captured network packets using Wireshark and analyzed HTTP, DNS, etc.
7. Automated blocking of malicious IPs using external blocklists.
